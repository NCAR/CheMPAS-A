# Chapter 2: Supercell with ABBA and LNOx

## 2.1 What you'll learn

By the end of this chapter you will:

- Run the supercell idealized convection case in CheMPAS-A.
- Switch between two MUSICA/MICM chemistry mechanisms — the toy ABBA
  reactant set and the LNOx + O3 lightning-NOx tropospheric setup —
  by editing the `&musica` namelist block.
- Compare what tracer transport looks like in isolation (ABBA) against
  what it looks like coupled to active gas-phase chemistry and a
  lightning-NOx source (LNOx + O3).

## 2.2 The supercell case

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

```

The supercell test case is an idealized deep-convection setup adapted
from Weisman and Klemp (1982): a horizontally homogeneous, strongly
sheared environment perturbed by a warm bubble that triggers a
long-lived rotating storm. CheMPAS-A's tracked configuration
uses 60 stretched vertical levels spanning 0–50 km (~300 m at the
surface, ~1 km near the lid), a 3-second dynamics timestep, Kessler
warm-rain microphysics, and a 2-hour integration.

It is a useful chemistry testbed for two reasons. First, the rotating
updraft produces strong, well-organized vertical transport that lifts
boundary-layer tracers into the upper troposphere; the cold-pool
outflow then spreads species horizontally near the surface. Second,
the dynamics are deterministic and the chemistry adds no feedback to
the dynamics — which means a chemistry change shows up cleanly as a
chemistry-only signal, rather than confounded with a different storm
evolution.

## 2.3 Setup checklist

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

Before you run anything, confirm:

```bash
# 1. The atmosphere_model executable exists and is from this branch.
ls -la ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/atmosphere_model

# 2. The supercell run directory is set up.
cd ~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell
ls namelist.atmosphere streams.atmosphere supercell.graph.info.part.8

# 3. The vertical-level file is in place (read by init_atmosphere_model).
ls supercell_zeta_levels.txt

# 4. The conda env is active for plotting.
conda activate mpas
python -c "import netCDF4, numpy, matplotlib; print('ok')"
```

If any of these fail, see `BUILD.md` in the repository root for the
model build, `RUN.md` in the repository root for the run-directory
layout, and `test_cases/README.md` for the data download.

## 2.4 Initialization

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

If `supercell_init.nc` is already in the run directory, you can skip
ahead to running the model. To regenerate the initial condition from
scratch:

```bash
cd ~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell
mpiexec -n 8 ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/init_atmosphere_model
```

This produces `supercell_init.nc`, which contains the prognostic state
on the unstructured Voronoi mesh, the stretched vertical levels read
from `supercell_zeta_levels.txt`, and the Kessler microphysics
variables.

Always run with 8 MPI ranks for the supercell case — the partition
file in the run directory (`supercell.graph.info.part.8`) is keyed to
that rank count, and a mismatched partition file causes a segfault in
the dynamics solver. See `RUN.md` in the repository root for the full
rank-vs-partition table.

## 2.5 Run with the ABBA mechanism

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

The ABBA mechanism (`micm_configs/abba.yaml`) is a three-species toy
set — qA, qB, qAB — used as an advection-dominated sandbox. The
mechanism initializes qAB to a uniform 1.0 and runs a slow two-way
reaction (qAB → qA + qB at scaling 2e-3, qA + qB → qAB at 1e-3); on
the supercell run duration the chemistry barely advances, so the
tracer fields are dominated by transport rather than reaction. This
makes ABBA a clean way to verify that tracers are being carried by
the dynamics correctly before adding real chemistry on top.

**Initialize the ABBA tracer.** Give qAB a horizontal sine pattern so
the supercell flow has something to advect (without this step, qAB is
uniform and the resulting plot has no structure):

```bash
cd ~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/python \
    ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/scripts/init_tracer_sine.py \
    -i supercell_init.nc -t qAB --waves-x 2 --amplitude 0.4 --offset 0.6
```

This sets qAB to a sine pattern with mean 0.6 and amplitude 0.4 across
two horizontal wavelengths.

**Edit the namelist.** Open `namelist.atmosphere` in
`~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell/` and ensure the `&musica` block reads:

```fortran
&musica
    config_micm_file = 'abba.yaml'
/
```

ABBA does not need TUV-x photolysis or the lightning-NOx options, so
the block is minimal.

**Archive any prior output and run.** MPAS defaults to
`clobber_mode = never_modify`; if `output.nc` already exists the run
will silently skip all output writes. Always move the previous output
aside before re-running:

```bash
cd ~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell

timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
[ -f output.nc ] && mv output.nc output.${timestamp}.nc
[ -f log.atmosphere.0000.out ] && \
    mv log.atmosphere.0000.out log.atmosphere.0000.${timestamp}.out

mpiexec -n 8 ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/atmosphere_model
```

**Verify the run completed cleanly.** The tail of
`log.atmosphere.0000.out` should report zero critical errors:

```
Critical error messages = 0
```

**Plot.** With the conda env active:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/python \
    ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/scripts/plot_chemistry.py -o supercell_abba.png
```

**[Figure 2.2: qA, qB, qAB at t = 2 h, ABBA mechanism. To be added.]**

What to look for: the qAB sine pattern is advected and distorted by
the updraft and cold-pool outflow, so qAB at t = 2 h is essentially
the initial sine field carried by the flow. qA and qB grow slowly
from zero where qAB is dissociating; on this run duration their
amplitude is small but their pattern mirrors qAB.

## 2.6 Run with the LNOx + O3 mechanism

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

The LNOx + O3 setup (`micm_configs/lnox_o3.yaml`) is a tropospheric
gas-phase configuration with three prognostic species — NO, NO₂, and
O₃ — and a parameterized lightning-NOx source term tied to the model's
vertical velocity. It is the smallest realistic chemistry case in
CheMPAS-A: enough species and reactions to exercise the MICM solver,
TUV-x photolysis, and the LNOx source coupling, without the cost of a
full tropospheric mechanism.

**Initialize the LNOx tracers.** The supercell init file does not
contain NO / NO₂ / O₃; populate them with a one-time script:

```bash
cd ~/Data/CheMPAS/supercell
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/python \
    ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/scripts/init_lnox_o3.py -i supercell_init.nc
```

This sets NO = 0, NO₂ = 0, and O₃ = 50 ppbv (background) throughout
the domain.

**Edit the namelist.** Replace the `&musica` block in
`namelist.atmosphere` with the full LNOx tropospheric setup:

```fortran
&musica
    config_micm_file = 'lnox_o3.yaml'
    config_tuvx_config_file = 'tuvx_no2.json'
    config_tuvx_top_extension = .true.
    config_tuvx_extension_file = 'tuvx_upper_atm.csv'
    config_lnox_source_rate = 0.5
    config_lnox_w_threshold = 5.0
    config_lnox_w_ref = 10.0
    config_lnox_z_min = 5000.0
    config_lnox_z_max = 12000.0
    config_lnox_j_no2 = 0.01
    config_lnox_nox_tau = 0.0
    config_chemistry_latitude = 35.86
    config_chemistry_longitude = -97.93
/
```

The lightning-NOx source injects NO into grid cells where the vertical
velocity exceeds `config_lnox_w_threshold` and the height falls
between `config_lnox_z_min` and `config_lnox_z_max`. See
[docs/chempas/guides/TUVX_INTEGRATION.md](../chempas/guides/TUVX_INTEGRATION.md)
for the TUV-x configuration files referenced in the block.

**Archive prior output and run.** Same pattern as the ABBA run:

```bash
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
[ -f output.nc ] && mv output.nc output.${timestamp}.nc
[ -f log.atmosphere.0000.out ] && \
    mv log.atmosphere.0000.out log.atmosphere.0000.${timestamp}.out

mpiexec -n 8 ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/atmosphere_model
```

**Plot.** The dedicated LNOx plotting script produces the standard
diagnostic set (vertical cross-sections, time series, NO₂ partitioning
ratio):

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/python \
    ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/scripts/plot_lnox_o3.py
```

**[Figure 2.3: NO, NO₂, O₃ at t = 2 h, LNOx + O3 mechanism. To be added.]**

What to look for: a localized NO source in the updraft column where
the vertical-velocity threshold is exceeded, downwind transport of
NO + NO₂ along the anvil, and an O₃ depletion signature in the freshly
emitted plume (titration by NO).

## 2.7 Comparing the two runs

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

Placing the two final-state plots side by side highlights what's
shared and what differs. The dynamics are identical: the same updraft
and cold-pool outflow advect qAB in the ABBA run and NO/NO₂/O₃ in the
LNOx + O3 run, so the spatial pattern of "tracer carried by the flow"
matches between the two runs. The chemistry, on the other hand,
diverges. ABBA's qAB → qA + qB reaction is slow on the run duration,
so the qAB field at t = 2 h is essentially the initial sine pattern
deformed by the storm; qA and qB grow slowly from zero everywhere
qAB is dissociating. In the LNOx + O3 run the lightning-NOx source
localizes NO emission to a small volume in the updraft column, fast
NO–NO₂–O₃ photochemistry redistributes the partitioning, and an
O₃-titration signature appears where fresh NO is concentrated.

This is the pedagogical payoff of running the same dynamics with two
mechanisms: it isolates "what the flow does" from "what the chemistry
does."

LNOx + O3 chemistry at t = 2 h. To be added.]**

## 2.8 Verifying numerically

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

Visual agreement is reassuring but not sufficient. To check that the
final-state min/max/mean of the prognostic fields match a tracked
reference, run the regression suite from the repo root:

```bash
cd ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A
python scripts/regression.py run --case supercell
```

A PASS means every reference statistic in
`test_cases/supercell/regression_reference.yaml` is within the
configured relative tolerance (default `1e-3`). A FAIL prints the
offending field and its observed-vs-expected values.

The regression YAML — not this tutorial — is the source of truth for
expected numerical values. If the YAML changes (`--bless`), the
tutorial does not need to be edited.

## 2.10 Standalone ABBA box model

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

The same chemistry as §2.5, exercised in pure Python with no MPAS in
the loop. `scripts/musica_python/abba_box.py` loads
`micm_configs/abba.yaml` into a single-cell MICM solver, seeds qAB at
1 mol m⁻³, runs the slow two-way reaction for 2 hours, and writes
`abba_box.nc` plus `abba_box.png` next to the script. Useful for
poking at initial conditions or temperatures without rebuilding MPAS.

Pre-req:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/pip install musica
```

Run:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/python \
    ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/scripts/musica_python/abba_box.py
```

**[Figure 2.5: A, B, AB concentrations from the standalone ABBA box
model over a 2 h integration. To be added.]**

What to look for: AB drops from 1 mol m⁻³ toward the analytical
equilibrium (AB ≈ 0.268, A = B ≈ 0.732, set by k_fwd / k_rev = 2
mol m⁻³) within the first ~30 minutes of the run; the rest of the
2 h sits at steady state. The visible chemistry contrasts with
§2.5's "transport-dominated" framing — same reactions, but without
advection the box runs to its endpoint instead of being shaped by
the storm flow.

## 2.11 Standalone LNOx + O₃ box model

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: warning

Section content coming.
```

The standalone counterpart of §2.6, *minus* the lightning-NOx source
(which is a CheMPAS operator-split injection in
`mpas_lightning_nox.F`, not part of the MICM mechanism).
`scripts/musica_python/lnox_box.py` loads `micm_configs/lnox_o3.yaml`
into a single-cell MICM solver at mid-tropospheric conditions
(T = 240 K, P = 5×10⁴ Pa), seeds 1 ppb total NOx (50/50 NO/NO₂) and
50 ppb O₃, hardcodes `PHOTO.jNO2 = 0.01 s⁻¹` (matching CheMPAS-A's
`config_lnox_j_no2`), and runs for 2 hours.

Pre-req: same `pip install musica` as §2.10. Run:

```bash
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/python \
    ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS-A/scripts/musica_python/lnox_box.py
```

**[Figure 2.6: NO, NO₂, O₃ from the standalone LNOx + O₃ box model.
The first ~minute shows NO/NO₂ relaxing to the Leighton PSS; over
2 h, slow O₃ titration is visible. To be added.]**

What to look for: NO and NO₂ partitioning settles within ~1 minute
to the Leighton ratio (jNO₂ / k_{NO+O₃}·[O₃]) — at the script's
conditions the simulated [NO]/[NO₂] reaches ~2.2, matching the
analytical expression. O₃ stays essentially constant: in this
simplified mechanism the back-reaction NO₂ + hν → NO + O₃ exactly
balances NO + O₃ → NO₂ + O₂ once PSS is reached, so there is no
net titration on the run duration. A direct independent check of
the analytical PSS computation referenced in Chapter 3 §3.8.
