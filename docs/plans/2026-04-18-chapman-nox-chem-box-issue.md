# Chapman + NOx explodes qO3 on chem_box — open issue

## Problem

On the 64-cell `chem_box` mesh, running `chapman_nox.yaml` +
`tuvx_chapman_nox.json` (all four photolysis rates) produces an
explosion in qO3 within the first chemistry step:

```
t=0    qO3 max=23,981 ppb   qO max=0     (AFGL init)
t=5m   qO3 max=93,929,448 ppb   qO max=1.9e7 ppb
t=10m  qO3 max=105,028,599 ppb  qO max=1.9e7 ppb
```

qO3 saturates near 0.15 kg/kg (≈ 10 % mass fraction of air) — about
four orders of magnitude too large. qO pegs at ≈ 0.01 kg/kg.

Per-cell mass balance is preserved (total oxygen atoms conserved),
and the saturation value stays the same across several yaml tweaks,
which looks like a fixed point of whatever the mechanism is
actually solving — not a blow-up.

## Test case (64-cell chem_box)

All files are tracked in the repo so the run is reproducible:

- `test_cases/chem_box/namelist.atmosphere` — `config_dt = 3.0 s`,
  10–60 min run, 8-MPI-rank partition, `config_micm_file =
  chapman_nox.yaml`, `config_tuvx_config_file = tuvx_chapman_nox.json`,
  `config_tuvx_top_extension = .true.`,
  `config_tuvx_extension_file = tuvx_upper_atm.csv`.
- `test_cases/chem_box/streams.atmosphere`,
  `streams.init_atmosphere`, `stream_list.atmosphere.output`,
  `supercell_zeta_levels.txt`, `namelist.init_atmosphere`.
- `micm_configs/chapman_nox.yaml` — full Chapman + NOx mechanism (7
  species incl. M, O1D; 9 reactions; 4 photolysis channels).
- `micm_configs/chapman_nox_noO1D.yaml` — reduced variant with O1D
  folded into jO3_O1D → O (see hypothesis #2 below). Same 4-photolysis
  wiring so `tuvx_chapman_nox.json` works unchanged.
- `micm_configs/tuvx_chapman_nox.json` — TUV-x config: 4 photolysis
  reactions (jO2, jO3_O1D, jO3_O, jNO2), air/O2/O3 radiators all
  driven from MPAS host state.
- `micm_configs/tuvx_upper_atm.csv` — 10-layer 50→100 km US-Std-Atm
  extension (z, T, n_air, n_O3) appended above the MPAS column by
  `mpas_tuvx.F`.

Run directory: `~/Data/CheMPAS/chem_box/`. Init file
(`chem_box_init.nc`) has AFGL qO3 (max ≈ 24 ppb at surface, ≈ 8 ppm
at the stratopause), qO2 = 0.23141 kg/kg (dry air VMR 0.2095), qNO
and qNO2 with small smooth profiles, qO = qO1D = 0.

### Mesh and grid build (how the 64-cell case was constructed)

The chem_box mesh is a doubly-periodic planar hexagonal mesh, 8×8
cells at 500 m centre-to-centre spacing (domain 4000 m × 3464 m,
`on_a_sphere = "NO"`, `is_periodic = "YES"`). Vertical grid is 60
stretched levels to 50 km, reusing the supercell zeta profile. All
tools come from the `mpas` conda env (`mpas-tools` + `metis`
packages on conda-forge).

Exact reproduction from scratch, run in the chem_box run directory:

```bash
# 1. Build the 64-cell periodic hex mesh (8x8 at 500 m).
#    planar_hex writes an MPAS-format grid directly — no conversion
#    needed for atmosphere_model input.
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/planar_hex --nx 8 --ny 8 --dc 500 \
    -o chem_box_grid.nc

# 2. Derive the METIS graph description from the grid. MpasMeshConverter
#    writes a graph.info file as a side effect of converting; we use
#    the graph.info and discard the "converted" grid file since the
#    planar_hex output already matches MPAS format exactly.
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/MpasMeshConverter.x \
    chem_box_grid.nc /tmp/_converted.nc
mv graph.info chem_box.graph.info
rm -f /tmp/_converted.nc

# 3. Partition the graph for the MPI rank counts you'll run.
#    gpmetis is from conda-forge's `metis` package. The partition is
#    randomized, so the .part.N files won't byte-match another run,
#    but any valid 8-way partition works identically at runtime.
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/gpmetis chem_box.graph.info 8
~/miniconda3/envs/mpas/bin/gpmetis chem_box.graph.info 4

# 4. Copy the reference configs from the repo.
cp ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/test_cases/chem_box/* .

# 5. Initialize. init_case = 5 is the supercell (Weisman-Klemp)
#    thermodynamic sounding; chem_box reuses it for its moisture
#    column and as a background state for chemistry. Runs with
#    any of the partitions you generated (use -n matching a
#    .part.N file).
ln -sf ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/init_atmosphere_model .
mpiexec -n 4 ./init_atmosphere_model

# 6. Stage chemistry config + atmosphere executable.
ln -sf ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/atmosphere_model .
ln -sf ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/LANDUSE.TBL .
cp ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/micm_configs/chapman_nox.yaml .
cp ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/micm_configs/tuvx_chapman_nox.json .
cp ~/EarthSystem/CheMPAS/micm_configs/tuvx_upper_atm.csv .
```

Run the model with `mpiexec -n 8 ./atmosphere_model`. Outputs land
in `output.nc` (one snapshot per `output_interval` in
`streams.atmosphere`; set to `00:00:03` when debugging step-by-step
photolysis behaviour, `00:05:00` for normal runs).

Global attributes on `chem_box_grid.nc` captured by `ncdump -h` for
verification: `dc = 500.0 m`, `nx = 8`, `ny = 8`, `x_period = 4000 m`,
`y_period ≈ 3464.1 m`, 64 cells, 192 edges, 128 vertices.

## What was verified (facts, not hypotheses)

**Rate constants are correct.** Every ARRHENIUS rate, at T = 220 K,
matches JPL 2020 within 1 % after the cgs → SI conversion
(`×N_A × 10⁻⁶` for bimolecular, `×N_A² × 10⁻¹²` for termolecular).
Compared against the known-good `lnox_o3.yaml` `NO + O3` rate as a
ground-truth calibration point.

**MICM Arrhenius form** (from
`MUSICA/build/_deps/micm-src/include/micm/process/rate_constant/arrhenius_rate_constant.hpp`):
`k = A × exp(C/T) × (T/D)^B × (1 + E·P)` with defaults `D = 300`,
`E = 0`. Omitting D/E from the YAML is fine.

**Third-body M is handled correctly by MICM.** Earlier notes here
claimed `is_third_body` was parsed but never consumed. That was
wrong. Trace through the installed MUSICA library:

- `MUSICA/src/micm/v1_parse.cpp:38-41` → calls
  `s.SetThirdBody()` when the YAML sets `is third body: true`.
- `micm-src/include/micm/system/species.hpp:162` →
  `SetThirdBody` installs `parameterize_ = [](c){ return c.air_density_; }`.
- `micm-src/include/micm/system/phase.hpp:66-90` → parameterized
  species are filtered out of `StateSize`, `UniqueNames`, and
  `SpeciesNames`.
- `micm-src/include/micm/process/chemical_reaction.hpp:127-132` →
  during rate-constant evaluation, parameterized reactants are
  multiplied into `fixed_reactants` via `parameterize_(conditions)`,
  so R2 = A·(T/300)^B · air_density · [O] · [O2] (correct termolecular).
- Runtime log (`~/Data/CheMPAS/chem_box/log.atmosphere.0000.out:583-590`)
  confirms `state%species_ordering` lists **6** species (NO2, NO, O,
  O3, O2, O1D) — M is correctly excluded.
- `air_density_` units are mol m⁻³ (`conditions.hpp:14`), matching
  what the coupler sets (`rho / M_AIR`).

**Mesh & dynamics are fine.** `chem_box` with `lnox_o3.yaml` +
`tuvx_no2.json` runs cleanly for 10 min (qO3 stable at 50 ppb,
NO at 0). The same mesh with `chapman_nox.yaml` explodes in 5 min.

**TUV-x photolysis rates look reasonable by altitude** (extracted
from the `j_*` diagnostic fields in `output.nc` at t=5 min):

```
    z (km)          jO2        jO3_O      jO3_O1D         jNO2
     0.1    0.000e+00    2.758e-11    0.000e+00    2.786e-06
     9.2    0.000e+00    3.877e-10   3.723e-225    3.722e-05
    21.5    0.000e+00    2.393e-08    1.494e-53    1.390e-03
    35.4    0.000e+00    4.564e-06    2.150e-09    5.973e-03
    49.5    1.736e-10    4.407e-04    4.242e-04    8.438e-03
```

`jO2` is effectively zero everywhere except the MPAS top, as expected
(Schumann-Runge bands attenuated out). This is the **first** CheMPAS
run that has O2 photolysis in the mechanism; prior runs had `jNO2`
only via `lnox_o3.yaml`.

**Variants tried (all still explode):**
1. `A: 8.018e-17` (original, cgs units) — R2 too slow, qO3 DECAYS
   exponentially to ~0.4 ppb in 1 h.
2. `A: 6.0e-34` + M as reactant — same behaviour as #1 (wrong scale).
3. `A: 2.18e2` + M as reactant — qO3 EXPLODES as above.
4. Copied from canonical `MUSICA/configs/v1/chapman/config.yaml`
   (`A: 217.6, B: -2.4, D: 300, E: 0`) — same explosion as #3.
5. Removed `__tracer type: CONSTANT` from O2 — qO2 now depletes to
   25 % of initial, confirming mass balance, but qO3 still at same
   saturation value.
6. `chapman_nox_noO1D.yaml` — O1D dropped, jO3_O1D channel wired to
   produce O(3P) directly (R6 quenching collapsed into photolysis).
   **Output bit-for-bit identical to the full mechanism**; rules out
   O1D stiffness / zero-initial-value as the trigger.

## What the standalone MICM column model shows

`MUSICA/fortran/examples/column_model.F90` ships as a coupled TUV-x
+ MICM 1-D Chapman driver (120 layers, 0–120 km, Boulder CO, June
21, 15-min steps over 24 h). Rebuilt with `MUSICA_ENABLE_TESTS=ON`
and run against the canonical `MUSICA/configs/v1/chapman/config.yaml`:

```
t=0h : O3_max = 6.902e-06 mol/m³ at z = 21.5 km (AFGL-like init)
t=6h : O3_max = 6.902e-06 mol/m³              O_max = 5.5e-9
t=12h: O3_max = 6.929e-06 mol/m³              O_max = 5.7e-8
t=18h: O3_max = 6.995e-06 mol/m³              O_max = 1.1e-7
t=24h: O3_max = 6.995e-06 mol/m³              O_max = 6.3e-8
```

Stratopause O3 stays pinned at a physical ~15 ppm over 24 h. **No
explosion.** So the bug is NOT in MICM's Chapman mechanism itself —
it is specific to the CheMPAS + MUSICA coupling.

## The smoking gun: step-1 photolysis rates

Setting `output_interval = 00:00:03` (one snapshot per chemistry
step) and printing `[MUSICA] jO3_O min/max` at every step reveals a
dramatic anomaly at **step 1 only**:

```
step  1: jO3_O min= 3.634e-04  max= 5.627e-04   (nearly UNIFORM, TOA value everywhere)
step  2: jO3_O min= 1.661e-09  max= 4.518e-04   (normal column attenuation)
step  5: jO3_O min= 7.097e-10  max= 4.404e-04
step 10: jO3_O min= 3.433e-10  max= 4.404e-04
step 50: jO3_O min= 5.767e-11  max= 4.405e-04
step 200: jO3_O min= 1.375e-11  max= 4.409e-04   (correct surface attenuation)
```

At step 1, **every cell and level** is receiving the top-of-
atmosphere rate (no O3 column attenuation). From step 2 onward, the
profile is attenuated correctly. The column in `j_jO3_O` diagnostics
in `output.nc` at t=3 s matches the `[MUSICA]` log output for step 1
(3.6e-4 uniform), confirming this is not a logging artifact.

Given the rate constant R2 ≈ 45 000 × [O2] [M] s⁻¹ at surface, a
bootstrap pulse of O atoms from the step-1 UV blast is enough to
produce ~0.02 kg/kg of qO3 in one 3-s step (observed). On step 2
the now-huge O3 column heavily attenuates UV (proper operation of
TUV-x), but the damage has been done — the system has already
landed in the wrong attractor and cannot recover.

## Debug instrumentation confirmed the input to TUV-x is correct

Temporary instrumentation in `tuvx_compute_photolysis` (reverted
after use) logged the profile values handed to TUV-x at the first
few calls:

```
[DEBUG tuvx] call=0  air_nd(1)=2.36e19   temp_mid(1)=299 K
                     o3_nd(1)=6.34e11 molec/cm³  (≈ 20 ppb surface)
                     o3_ld col_sum=9.18e18 molec/cm²  (≈ 340 DU — realistic!)
```

Readback via `o3_profile%get_layer_densities` after
`set_layer_densities` returned **exactly** the same numbers we
passed in, so TUV-x's internal profile storage is populated
correctly on the first call.

**Warmup test** — calling `tuvx_solver%run()` twice at the first
chemistry step produced identical photolysis rates both times, so
this is NOT a lazy-initialization / first-call-is-stale issue
inside TUV-x.

Something downstream of the correctly-set profile is producing the
wrong radiative transfer result at step 1. Expected surface OD for
a 340 DU column at ~300 nm is ~3.7 → transmission ~2.5 %. TUV-x is
giving transmission ~26 % at the surface (OD ~1.3), about 12× less
attenuation than physics would predict.

## Line A results: what MICM actually sees and produces at step 1

Instrumented `MICM_from_chemistry`, `musica_set_photolysis_rates`,
and `MICM_to_chemistry` to dump, at cell 1 / level 1 / surface, for
the first two chemistry steps:

- all four `state%rate_parameters(PHOTO.*)` values,
- `state%conditions(1)%{temperature, pressure, air_density}`,
- the in-concentrations (`MICM-in`) and post-solve concentrations
  (`MICM-out`) for every non-parameterized species,
- stride layout (`species_strides`, `rate_parameters_strides`).

Stride layout is `cell_stride = n_species`, `var_stride = 1`
(row-major by grid cell), with MICM's own variable_map order
putting O2 at stride 1, O at stride 2, O3 at stride 3, NO at 4,
NO2 at 5 — matches the iteration order returned by MICM's
`species_ordering` when the Fortran coupler pairs names with
stride indices, so the MPAS↔MICM copy is correctly routed.

### Step-1 inputs are correct

```
[DEBUG MICM-in] T=299.09 K  P=98321 Pa  rho=1.14 kg/m³  air_density=39.2 mol/m³
[DEBUG MICM-in] NO2 conc=1.37e-9   q=5.56e-11
[DEBUG MICM-in] NO  conc=5.88e-10  q=1.55e-11
[DEBUG MICM-in] O3  conc=1.05e-6   q=4.45e-8
[DEBUG MICM-in] O   conc=0         q=0
[DEBUG MICM-in] O2  conc=8.21      q=0.2314
[DEBUG RP-in]   PHOTO.jNO2    = 6.74e-3
[DEBUG RP-in]   PHOTO.jO3_O1D = 8.87e-6
[DEBUG RP-in]   PHOTO.jO3_O   = 3.63e-4
[DEBUG RP-in]   PHOTO.jO2     = 3.92e-38
```

Everything we hand MICM at step 1 is what the coupler should hand
it: environment is correct, concentrations match the AFGL init, the
photolysis slots hold exactly the (anomalous-TOA) values TUV-x
emitted. The step-1 explosion is not a result of the coupler
overwriting with garbage.

### Step-1 MICM solve output has impossible mass imbalance

```
[DEBUG MICM-out] NO2 conc=0
[DEBUG MICM-out] NO  conc=8.67e-7   ← was 5.88e-10, grew 1475×
[DEBUG MICM-out] O3  conc=0.315     ← was 1.05e-6,  grew ~300 000×
[DEBUG MICM-out] O   conc=1.53e-6
[DEBUG MICM-out] O2  conc=7.74      ← was 8.21,      dropped 6%
```

Oxygen-atom balance is preserved at the cell level (the O2 loss
exactly accounts for the O + 3×O3 gain). **Nitrogen balance is
not** — total N at this cell grows from 1.96e-9 to 8.67e-7 mol m⁻³
(443×). Across the whole column the mean total-N mole fraction
grows 32× between t=0 and t=3 s, then stays constant through step
2 onward.

The Chapman steady state predicted by the rate constants for the
step-1 anomalous photolysis rates is `[O]_ss ≈ 5e-15 mol m⁻³` at
surface, with `d[O3]/dt ≈ 2e-11 mol m⁻³ s⁻¹` — i.e. qO3 should
barely move over 3 s. MICM evolves [O3] to 0.315 mol m⁻³ in that
single step, which is the wrong fixed point by ~13 orders of
magnitude.

### What this rules in and out

- **It is not a coupler data-transfer bug.** Inputs are verified
  clean at the cell level.
- **It is not a rate_parameter scaling_factor issue.** All our
  photolysis reactions default to `scaling_factor = 1.0` and MICM
  applies `k = custom_parameter × scaling_factor`, so the
  effective j equals exactly what TUV-x wrote. Ruled out.
- **It is not a stride/indexing mixup.** Stride layout is verified.
- **It IS a solver fidelity problem inside MICM.** The combination
  of a huge (anomalous) step-1 photolysis rate, zero initial [O],
  a very stiff Chapman cycle (R2 timescale ~14 μs at surface), and
  a 3 s outer dt, drives Rosenbrock into an unphysical attractor
  where oxygen is conserved at the cell level but N is created and
  O3 overshoots by ~5 orders. The solver reports "9 accepted, 0
  rejected" — it thinks it converged.

This leaves TWO independent problems to fix:

1. **Step-1 TOA photolysis rates.** TUV-x must attenuate through
   the provided O3 column on the first call. (Lines B work.)
2. **MICM Rosenbrock robustness.** Even if photolysis is correct,
   the current combination of tolerance settings and dt seems
   fragile. Worth testing loosened `__absolute tolerance`, a small
   non-zero seed for [O], or a different solver family.

### Backward Euler solver test

Swapped `musica_init` from `RosenbrockStandardOrder` to
`BackwardEulerStandardOrder` in `mpas_musica.F` and reran the same
chem_box + `chapman_nox_noO1D.yaml` case. Result:

```
              qO3 mean (kg/kg)       Total N (mol N / kg air)
t=0           5.07e-6                1.19e-7
t=3 s         1.52e-2  (3000× up)    1.19e-7  (conserved)
t=6 s         1.98e-2                1.19e-7
```

**Backward Euler preserves nitrogen mass balance at step 1.** The
32×-column-mean N-creation that Rosenbrock produces is gone
entirely with BE. This is direct evidence that the step-1 N
imbalance was a Rosenbrock-specific numerical artifact (probably
the implicit step evaluating the Jacobian at a near-degenerate
state with tight 1e-12 absolute tolerances and zero initial [O]),
NOT a mechanism or coupler bug.

**Backward Euler does not prevent the qO3 explosion.** qO3 still
jumps from 5e-6 to 1.5e-2 kg/kg (mean) in one 3 s step — slightly
less than Rosenbrock's ~5× bigger jump, but still ~3000× too high.
BE faithfully integrates the rate equations; it can't compensate
for a physical photolysis forcing that is 5 orders of magnitude too
strong. The step-1 TOA-photolysis problem is the primary driver of
the O3 blowup, not the solver.

**Decision:** keep Backward Euler as the production solver for now.
It removes the N-balance violation, makes MICM's output physically
interpretable under every condition we've tested, and has no
apparent downsides for this mechanism (3 s dt, tightly-coupled
null cycles). The Rosenbrock path can be revisited if/when we find
a mechanism that demonstrably needs higher-order stiff accuracy.

## Line B results: TUV-x is not the bug

B1 (analytical sanity check) corrected an earlier misreading of
the step-1 rates. Comparing each channel to published WACCM/ACOM
reference values at noon mid-latitude conditions:

| Channel            | Observed step 1 | Published (noon mid-lat) | Status |
|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------|
| jO2 (SR bands)     | ~0              | ~0 (absorbed above)      | ✓      |
| jO3_O (Chappuis)   | 3.6e-4          | 2–5e-4                   | ✓      |
| jO3_O1D (Hartley)  | 8.87e-6         | 1–5e-5                   | ✓      |
| jNO2 (UV-Vis)      | 6.7e-3          | ~1e-2                    | ✓      |

The earlier narrative that jO3_O was "5 orders too high at surface"
came from comparing the Chappuis `jO3_O` (weakly self-absorbed by
O3, so surface ≈ TOA/few) against expectations for the strongly-
attenuated Hartley `jO3_O1D` channel. Chappuis surface rates of
~10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ are physically normal. The step-1 rates are correct.

B2 (standalone `MUSICA/fortran/examples/test_tuvx_v54` built
against the installed MUSICA) confirms this. At SZA = 0 with the
US-Std-Atm column, TUV-x emits `jO3_O = 4.98e-4` and `jO3_O1D =
4.83e-5` at the surface — consistent with our chem_box step-1
rates after scaling down for SZA ≈ 58° (cos scaling gives the
observed ~0.7× for Chappuis and ~0.2× for Hartley).

B3 + B4 (coupling completeness fixes) implemented in
`mpas_tuvx.F`: `set_edge_values` is now called for the O3 and O2
profiles (previously only midpoints + layer densities were set,
leaving edge arrays at their constructor zeros), and
`calculate_exo_layer_density(7 km)` populates the air profile's
exo layer density so spherical-geometry slant-path integration
accounts for air above the 100 km extension top. These are real
correctness fixes that should be in even though they did **not**
change any photolysis output in the chem_box test — the surface
rates for a 340-DU column at SZA = 58° are physically what we
were already seeing, and the base radiator's optical-depth
calculation uses `layer_dens_` (which we were already writing
correctly), not edge values.

B5 (direct TUV-x radiator instrumentation) was not pursued: B1+B2
make it clear the RT solver is doing the right thing for this
column, and deeper instrumentation is unlikely to find a bug that
isn't there.

**Line B conclusion:** TUV-x is producing the physically correct
photolysis rates at step 1. The qO3 explosion is driven entirely
by the MICM solver's response to full-strength photolysis applied
to an initial state with `[O] = 0`. Even Backward Euler, with a
3 s outer dt that is 10⁵–10⁶ larger than the fastest Chapman mode,
lands on an implicit fixed point where [O2] has been converted to
[O3] + [O] at levels far above what the Chapman/NOx chemistry
should produce physically. Total oxygen atoms ARE conserved at
the cell level (verified at cell 1 surface: 16.42 in = 16.42 out
mol m⁻³ of O). The mechanism moves a large fraction of [O2] into
[O3] + [O] in a single 3 s step, which is numerically self-
consistent with BE's implicit step but not what Chapman physics
would give in a well-resolved transient.

## What actually fixes the explosion

None of the Line A or Line B work above addresses the root cause
directly — they rule hypotheses out. Real fixes to try, in rough
order of cost:

1. **Seed qO with a small non-zero value at init.** Modifying
   `scripts/init_chapman.py` to write a small [O] profile
   (e.g. Chapman quasi-steady-state values, or just `1e-15`
   everywhere) may be enough to break the degeneracy that lets
   BE's Newton iteration land on the wrong implicit fixed point.
2. **Loosen `__absolute tolerance` on O / O1D / NO / NO2 from
   `1e-12` to `1e-10` or `1e-8`** in `chapman_nox.yaml`. The
   very tight tolerance on species that start at zero makes the
   BE Newton solve prone to picking self-consistent but non-
   physical end states.
3. **Shorten `config_dt` for the first few steps** (run a pre-
   dawn spinup, or reduce `config_dt` to 0.1 s for the first
   10 s). Avoid presenting BE with a 3 s step while the fast
   Chapman null cycle is spinning up from zero.
4. **Start `config_start_time` at night (cos_sza ≤ 0)** so
   photolysis ramps up naturally and [O] has time to track.
   This is what `MUSICA/fortran/examples/column_model.F90` does,
   and it doesn't explode.

Option 4 is closest to the MUSICA reference usage pattern and is
the cheapest to try first.

## Tests of options 1 + 2 — did NOT fix the explosion

On 2026-04-18, tried options 1 and 2 together:

- `scripts/init_chapman.py` changed to write `qO = 1e-12 kg/kg`
  (uniform) instead of exactly zero. Corresponds to `[O] ≈ 7e-11
  mol/m³` at surface and `3e-10 mol/m³` at the stratopause — well
  above any MICM absolute tolerance but chemically negligible.
  Committed.
- `chapman_nox.yaml` and `chapman_nox_noO1D.yaml` changed from
  `__absolute tolerance: 1e-12` to `1e-10` on all radical species.
  Also tested with tolerance relaxed all the way to `1e-6`.
  Committed at 1e-10.

Result: **output is bit-for-bit identical to the pre-change
Backward Euler run.** qO3 still jumps from 5.07e-6 → 1.52e-2
(mean, kg/kg) in one 3 s step. The implicit fixed point Backward
Euler lands on does not depend on the initial [O] value or the
absolute-tolerance floor.

### Why these knobs didn't matter (important correction)

The reason is adaptive sub-stepping. MICM's Rosenbrock and
Backward Euler solvers are both adaptive: within a single
`micm%solve(dt, ...)` call for MPAS dt = 3 s, the solver takes
multiple internal sub-steps (Rosenbrock took 9 accepted sub-steps
per earlier logs). Which sub-step sizes the solver chooses is
driven by its **step-size error controller**, which compares step
estimates against the error tolerances.

- `absolute_tolerance` matters mostly for species near zero; it
  sets the floor below which error is considered negligible.
  Loosening it 1e-12 → 1e-6 only relaxes the floor — it does not
  force smaller sub-steps during the stiff transient.
- `relative_tolerance` (default `1e-6`, set via the solver
  parameters API, not the YAML) controls the per-species
  tolerance relative to magnitude. This is what drives the
  sub-step size through the stiff Chapman null-cycle transient.
  Tightening it forces the adaptive controller to take smaller
  internal steps.

Options 1+2 don't touch `relative_tolerance`, which is why they
make no difference: the adaptive controller keeps accepting the
same ~0.3 s sub-steps that land the implicit Newton iterate on
the wrong fixed point.

### Deeper reason: "adaptive and converged" ≠ "correct"

The adaptive controller only measures *local* truncation error
against the tolerances. It has no view of physical correctness.
For a Backward Euler implicit solve of stiff Chapman chemistry
starting from `[O] = 0` with full-strength photolysis, the
implicit equation

```
y_{n+1} - y_n - dt · f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = 0
```

has more than one physically-distinct root within the 3 s outer
dt: the true gradual-ramp-up trajectory where [O] slowly builds
from photolysis, and the far-field attractor where [O2] has
already been converted to [O3] + [O] at ~10% mass-fraction
levels. Newton lands on whichever root is closer to its
linearization, not necessarily the physical one.

The adaptive controller sub-divides when its estimate of the
local error |y_new − y_old_extrapolated| exceeds the tolerance.
But if Newton is converging to the wrong root at *every*
sub-step, those local errors can still be small — the solver
has no way to tell "the root I'm finding is physically wrong."
That's why the Line A logs show "9 accepted, 0 rejected" — the
solver literally thinks it converged.

**What shortening the outer dt does** (that no internal stepper
can replicate): shrink the neighborhood where the implicit
equation has multiple roots. At `dt = 0.1 s`, `dt · f` is small,
so Newton is forced to land near the initial state — i.e., on
the physical trajectory. With many short outer steps, [O]
builds up stepwise from photolysis and the Chapman null cycle
tracks reality. By the time outer dt returns to 3 s, the state
is no longer degenerate.

Corollary: **starting at night** (`cos_sza < 0`, option 4) has
the same effect for free. With photolysis rates at zero,
`dt · f ≈ 0` regardless of outer dt, so the implicit solve is
trivial. As photolysis ramps up smoothly through dawn, [O]
builds up gradually at naturally-small j-values. No Newton
degeneracy ever develops. This is why the MUSICA column model
(`fortran/examples/column_model.F90`) never sees the
explosion — it starts pre-dawn by construction.

Operator splitting is a secondary factor: chemistry and
dynamics are split at the outer-dt boundary with the photolysis
rates frozen during the MICM solve. Shorter outer dt means less
splitting error when j-values are changing rapidly (e.g. across
sunrise). This is first-order in outer dt and cannot be
recovered by any amount of internal adaptive stepping.

## Next planned test — tighten `relative_tolerance`

Extend `musica_init` in `mpas_musica.F` to call
`micm%set_backward_euler_solver_parameters(params, error)` right
after `get_state`, where `params` is a
`backward_euler_solver_parameters_t` with:

- `relative_tolerance = 1e-9` (or tighter, 1e-12, to bracket)
- `max_number_of_steps = 30` (default 11 — give the adaptive
  controller more budget to take many small sub-steps)
- `time_step_reductions = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.01]` (default
  [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.1] — be more aggressive when Newton
  fails to converge)

If tighter `relative_tolerance` makes the step-1 trajectory
physically reasonable, that both confirms the diagnosis and
gives us a production fix. If it still lands on the wrong fixed
point, the next move is to instrument MICM's Newton iterate
itself (log the residual and iterate count per sub-step) —
that's a MICM-side change and probably worth an upstream issue.

### Handoff status at 2026-04-18 end-of-session

Committed on `develop`:
- `eac18d5` — solver switch Rosenbrock → Backward Euler.
- `6f95416` — TUV-x edge values + exo layer density (coupling
  completeness, does not affect the explosion).
- Pending this commit — `__absolute tolerance` 1e-12 → 1e-10,
  `qO` seed 1e-12 kg/kg in `init_chapman.py`, Line B results,
  "tests of options 1 + 2" and "next planned test" sections.

Run-directory state (`~/Data/CheMPAS/chem_box/`, not tracked):
- `chem_box_init.nc` re-initialized with the new qO seed via
  `python scripts/init_chapman.py --input ...`.
- `chapman_nox.yaml` copied from repo's `chapman_nox_noO1D.yaml`
  (for the reduced-mechanism test path).

Not committed — open work:
- Implement `set_backward_euler_solver_parameters` call in
  `mpas_musica.F::musica_init` with tighter `relative_tolerance`
  as described above.
- Rebuild, rerun, compare qO3 trajectory against the
  pre-tolerance-change baseline.
- If successful, decide on production tolerance values and
  whether to expose them via namelist.

## 2026-04-18 update: handoff API gap + pivoting to option 4

Picked up the handoff on the macOS side. Two findings before
running the next test:

1. **The Fortran binding `set_backward_euler_solver_parameters`
   doesn't exist** in the installed MUSICA-Fortran. Searched
   `MUSICA-LLVM/fortran/{micm,state}.F90`, the C interface
   (`src/micm/{micm,state}_c_interface.cpp`), and
   `libmusica.a` symbols — no `Set*SolverParameters`, no
   `SetRelativeTolerance`, nothing tolerance-related beyond
   what v1 parses from YAML (`absolute_tolerance` per species
   only).
2. **Upstream `BackwardEulerSolverParameters` does not contain
   `relative_tolerance`.** From
   `build/_deps/micm-src/include/micm/solver/backward_euler_solver_parameters.hpp`
   it has only `{small_, h_start_, max_number_of_steps_,
   time_step_reductions_}`. `relative_tolerance_` is a scalar
   on `State` (default `1e-06`, `micm-src/.../solver/state.hpp:34`),
   set via direct C++ assignment — not exposed via any C API.

So following the handoff literally requires a cross-repo MUSICA
API addition (new C shim for `state.relative_tolerance_` and
BE param setters, matching Fortran bindings, rebuild MUSICA-LLVM,
rebuild CheMPAS). Deferring that; trying option 4 first —
pre-dawn start — since it targets the same root cause
(degenerate implicit-solve neighborhood at full-strength
photolysis) with only a namelist edit.

Test plan (option 4):
- `config_start_time = '0000-01-01_10:00:00'` (04:00 local at
  chem_lat 35.86, chem_lon -97.93 → pre-dawn, cos_sza < 0)
- `config_run_duration = '09:00:00'` → finishes 19:00 UTC
  (13:00 local, ~30 min past solar noon)
- dt = 3 s unchanged, BE solver unchanged, qO seed unchanged.
- Crosses civil-twilight (~12:35 UTC) and sunrise (~13:30 UTC);
  photolysis ramps up from zero over ~1 h.
- Pass condition: qO3 stays within ~2× AFGL profile through
  noon; no 1e4× saturation.
- Fail condition: same saturation as daytime start — implies
  the Newton-degeneracy happens again at the sunrise crossing,
  which would mean shortening dt across dawn (not just starting
  earlier) is the real fix.

## Hypotheses still on the table

1. **TUV-x radiator update ordering.** `radiator_from_host_t::update_state`
   in `MUSICA/build/_deps/tuvx-src/src/radiative_transfer/radiators/from_host.F90`
   is a no-op. The "base" radiator (used by air/O2/O3 in our TUV-x
   config) has an `update_state` in `radiator.F90:169-230` that reads
   `radiator_profile%layer_dens_` to compute `layer_OD_`, and is
   called from `radiative_transfer%calculate:170-177`. In principle
   this should run on every `tuvx_solver%run()`. Worth confirming
   that on step 1 the base radiator's `layer_OD_` actually reflects
   our provided `layer_dens_`.
2. **MICM photolysis scaling_factor.** `UserDefinedRateConstant::Calculate`
   returns `custom_parameter × scaling_factor_`. Default is 1.0, but
   if our YAML's photolysis reactions inherit a different factor, the
   effective rate would be amplified. Worth grepping `scaling_factor`
   in the running build and logging the actual `k` MICM computes
   per photolysis reaction at step 1.
3. **Profile edge values never set for O3/O2.** `tuvx_compute_photolysis`
   calls `set_midpoint_values` + `set_layer_densities` for O3 and O2,
   but not `set_edge_values`. `edge_val_` stays at the constructor
   default of zero. The canonical `profile_from_host_t::update()`
   (not exposed via C bindings) REQUIRES edge_values. Possibly the
   radiative transfer solver reads edge_val_ somewhere.
4. **`exo_layer_dens_(N+1)` never updated.** `internal_set_layer_densities`
   populates `layer_dens_(1:N)` and `exo_layer_dens_(1:N)` but leaves
   `exo_layer_dens_(N+1)` at the constructor zero. The canonical
   `update()` sets it from `edge_val_(N+1) * hscale_`. Used by
   spherical geometry air-mass in `radiative_transfer%calculate`
   (air profile only). Probably not the bug — air column has zero
   above the extension anyway — but worth ruling out.
5. **Rosenbrock stiffness failure.** With `__absolute tolerance: 1e-12`
   on O/O1D and an initial state of exactly zero, the first Jacobian
   could be degenerate. Looser tolerances (`1e-10`) and seeding a
   small non-zero qO haven't been tried yet. But removing O1D
   entirely (variant #6 above) didn't help, which argues against
   pure solver stiffness as the culprit.

## Current state shipped

- `chapman_nox.yaml` in canonical MICM-v1 form with SI rate
  constants (correct per JPL); the explosion is reproducible.
- `chapman_nox_noO1D.yaml` reduced mechanism; also explodes.
- `chem_box` test case can be used for multi-day LNOx diurnal-cycle
  work with `lnox_o3.yaml` while this is being debugged.
- All multi-photolysis plumbing (mpas_tuvx.F multi-rate,
  `musica_set_photolysis_rates`, `j_<name>` diagnostic fields) is
  working correctly — confirmed by TUV-x rates appearing in the
  output with sensible altitude dependence from step 2 onward.
- Standalone MICM column model (`MUSICA/fortran/examples/`) is
  built and runs the canonical Chapman config successfully — use
  this as a reference oracle when debugging.

## Path forward

Two parallel lines of investigation:

**Line A — confirm MICM rate constants at step 1.** Briefly
instrument MICM (or dump `state%rate_constants_`) to confirm the
effective `k` for each reaction at step 1 is what we expect from
the j-values we fed in. Rules in/out hypothesis #2.

**Line B — accept step-1 photo rates as the trigger; ask why
TUV-x produces TOA rates for a 340-DU column.** Candidates:
hypothesis #1 (radiator refresh), #3 (missing edge values), #4
(exo layer density). Could also be reproduced in a pure-TUV-x
standalone driver fed the same profile.

Lower-risk workaround if neither A nor B resolves quickly: skip
chemistry on the very first step (let dynamics run once, then
allow chem to start). That sidesteps the bootstrap without
addressing the root cause. Not a real fix — flag it as mitigation
only.

## 2026-04-18 pm session: root cause pinned to stiffness

Two new shipped commits:
- Re-entrant `micm%solve` loop in `mpas_musica.F::musica_step` and
  `musica_step_ref`: if the solver returns early with
  `solver_stats%final_time() < time_step`, resubmit the remainder
  until the full `time_step` is covered. Matches the pattern in
  `MUSICA/fortran/examples/column_model.F90:217-229`.
- `config_chem_substeps` namelist option (default 1) and outer loop
  in `mpas_atm_chemistry.F::chemistry_step` that calls
  `musica_step(dt/N)` N times per MPAS step, with the TUV-x
  photolysis rates frozen across sub-steps. No MUSICA changes.

### The handoff plan's `relative_tolerance` proposal required cross-repo work

`set_backward_euler_solver_parameters` does not exist as a Fortran
binding in installed MUSICA-Fortran. Searched
`MUSICA-LLVM/fortran/{micm,state}.F90`,
`src/micm/{micm,state}_c_interface.cpp`, and `libmusica.a` symbols —
no `Set*SolverParameters`, no `SetRelativeTolerance`. Upstream
`BackwardEulerSolverParameters` does not even contain
`relative_tolerance_`; that scalar lives on `State` (default `1e-06`,
`micm-src/.../solver/state.hpp:34`) and has no C accessor. Pursuing
the proposal as written would need new entry points in MUSICA-LLVM.

### Sub-stepping alone does NOT fix the full Chapman run

Ran `chapman_nox.yaml` with `config_chem_substeps = 30` (dt = 0.1 s)
at 18:00 UTC. Result: **qO3 explodes identically** — 24000 → 9.4e7 ppb
at 5 min, same as `config_chem_substeps = 1`.

Reason: the R2 termolecular (O + O2 + M → O3 + M) has
`k2·[O2]·[M] ≈ 4.5e4 s⁻¹` at surface, so `τ_O ≈ 14 µs`. At dt = 0.1 s,
`dt/τ_O ≈ 1e4` — still massively stiff. Newton's multi-root pathology
persists. Shortening dt by finite factors cannot outrun a µs-scale
stiffness; you would need dt < 1 µs.

### Sanity tests — what the solver actually does

Three progressively-simpler mechanisms tested on `chem_box` at 18:00 UTC,
dt=3s, `config_chem_substeps = 1`:

**Test A: atom-non-conservative `O2 → 2 O3`.** Broken stoichiometry
(creates 4 O atoms per photolysis). qO3 mean grew 5e-6 → 0.29 kg/kg at
5 min; qO2 mean dropped 0.23 → 0.13; net O-atom mass change
+0.19 kg / kg air. **BE landed on an unphysical root specifically
because unbalanced stoichiometry gave the implicit equation extra roots
to find.** Lesson: sanity checks must preserve atom conservation or
they fail for uninformative reasons.

**Test B: atom-conservative decay-only `chapman_nox_no_O.yaml`.**
No [O], no [O1D], no production of O3 from O2. Reactions:
`O3 → (nothing)` (jO3_O sink), `NO + O3 → NO2 + O2`,
`NO2 → NO` (jNO2 sink). qO3 max decayed monotonically
24000 → 750 → 23 ppb (t = 0, 5, 10 min). qO2 unchanged. qNO/qNO2
fluctuate stably through the Leighton cycle. **No explosion.**
MICM/BE handles atom-conservative non-stiff chemistry cleanly.

**Test C: `chapman_nox_slow.yaml` — same topology, rates scaled 1e-6 on
R2 and R6.** `τ_O` 14 µs → 14 s, `τ_O1D` ~1 µs → ~1 s; no longer stiff
at dt = 3 s. Full species set {M, O, O1D, O2, O3, NO, NO2} and all 9
reactions present. Result: qO3 max 24000 → 1668 → 1660 ppb, qO rises
to 0.22 kg/kg at column top (unphysical equilibrium for the bogus
rates, but the system is on the attractor those rates define). **Atom
balance exact at every level, every timestep:
qO + qO2 + qO3 = 0.2314 kg/kg everywhere.** No runaway, no wrong root.

### Conclusion

Stiffness is the cause. The microsecond `[O]/[O3]` null cycle creates
a multi-root implicit equation at any practical dt; BE's Newton
iterate picks the non-physical root when started from a degenerate
state (`[O] ≈ 0` with full photolysis). MICM is *not* broken — on
atom-conservative non-stiff systems it integrates correctly, and when
Newton starts from a non-degenerate state on the physical attractor it
stays there.

### Implication: Newton stability on the attractor

BE's Newton iterate linearizes around its starting guess (typically
`y_old`). With `y_old` in a degenerate neighborhood ([O] ≈ 0, full
photolysis), the Jacobian is ill-conditioned — the loss term
`k2·[O]·[O2]·[M]` is dominated by `[O]` going to zero, so there is no
restoring force toward small [O], and the far-field attractor is
within reach. With `y_old = [O]_ss`, the Jacobian has active loss
terms and Newton's linearization lands on the nearest root — the
physical one.

This means: once the system is spun up to QSS, normal dt is safe. The
only unsafe moments are when something pushes the state into a
degenerate neighborhood (cold start, sunrise after long night with
[O] not at QSS, impulsive perturbations).

### Next test — warmup strategy

Run the first N MPAS chemistry steps with `config_chem_substeps` very
high (e.g. 3000 → dt = 0.001 s, below `τ_O` at all altitudes up to
stratosphere) so Newton is forced to the physical root every step and
[O] builds up to QSS. After N steps, drop `config_chem_substeps = 1`
and continue at the full 3 s outer dt; rely on attractor stability
to keep Newton on the physical manifold.

To implement without per-step namelist churn: add
`config_chem_warmup_steps` and `config_chem_warmup_substeps` options
and switch to `config_chem_substeps` once the counter elapses.

If this works, it's a cheap production fix for the cold-start case and
a clean model for handling sunrise in longer runs (same pattern, just
triggered by cos_sza transitions rather than step count).

## 2026-04-18 late-evening: pivoting to solver-API and QSS-seed tests

Built the cross-repo MICM tolerance-setting API that the handoff plan had
assumed existed:

- `MUSICA-LLVM/include/musica/micm/state_c_interface.hpp` +
  `src/micm/state_c_interface.cpp`: new `SetRelativeTolerance(state, value, error)`
  C entry point. Uses `std::visit` to set `state.relative_tolerance_` on
  whichever `StateVariant` the solver chose (VectorState / StandardState /
  GpuState). Mass-conservative wrt. the existing State object.
- `MUSICA-LLVM/fortran/micm/state.F90`: matching Fortran binding
  `set_relative_tolerance_c` and a `state_t%set_relative_tolerance(value, error)`
  method. No API churn elsewhere.
- Rebuilt MUSICA-LLVM and installed updated `libmusica.a`,
  `libmusica-fortran.a`, `libmechanism_configuration.a`, and `*.mod`
  files into `~/software`.
- `CheMPAS/src/core_atmosphere/Registry.xml`: added
  `config_micm_relative_tolerance` (default `1e-6`, MICM's default).
- `CheMPAS/src/core_atmosphere/chemistry/mpas_atm_chemistry.F`: reads
  the namelist option and passes it through to `musica_init`.
- `CheMPAS/src/core_atmosphere/chemistry/musica/mpas_musica.F`:
  `musica_init` now accepts `relative_tolerance` and calls
  `state%set_relative_tolerance(relative_tolerance, error)` on both
  the coupled and reference states immediately after `get_state`.

The API works and logs confirm the tolerance is applied.

### Result: tightening rel_tol does NOT fix the explosion

With BE and `config_micm_relative_tolerance = 1e-9`: bit-for-bit
identical explosion (qO3 24000 → 9.4e7 ppb at 5 min). Solver stats:
`accepted=1, rejected=0` per call — the adaptive controller never
triggers.

With BE and `rel_tol = 1e-15` (near machine precision): same.

**Why rel_tol is ineffective here.** From
`micm-src/include/micm/solver/backward_euler.inl:IsConverged`:

```
|residual| > small AND |residual| > abs_tol[i] AND |residual| > rel_tol * |Yn+1|
```

All three must hold for non-convergence. At the wrong root,
`|Yn+1|` for qO3 is ≈ 0.3 mol/m³, so `rel_tol * |Yn+1|` at
`rel_tol = 1e-15` is `3e-16` — Newton's residuals drop below that
trivially once converging. Tightening rel_tol makes Newton converge
*more precisely* to the wrong root; it does not force a step-size
reduction because the `!converged → H *= time_step_reductions[...]`
branch never fires.

### Result: Rosenbrock instead of BE

Switched `solver_type = RosenbrockStandardOrder` in
`mpas_musica.F::musica_init`. Rosenbrock has true embedded error
estimation (step-doubling), not Newton convergence, so it *should*
respond to tighter rel_tol by rejecting large H steps. Tested at
`rel_tol = 1e-9` and `rel_tol = 1e-15`:

- qO3 evolution: 24000 → 9.4e7 ppb at 5 min — identical to BE.
- Solver stats: `accepted=9, rejected=0` — same 9 internal sub-steps
  Rosenbrock took in Ubuntu Claude's earlier Line A test. Not a single
  rejection at any tolerance.

**Why Rosenbrock's error estimator is also ineffective here.** The
embedded estimate compares the full-order and lower-order methods'
predictions of `y_new` at the same H. Along the wrong-attractor
trajectory, both estimates agree — the step is "accurate" in the
sense that the two methods produce consistent answers. They just
consistently go to the wrong place. No purely consistency-based
error estimator can discriminate physical from non-physical roots.

### Result: physical QSS seeding of [O]

Extended `scripts/init_chapman.py` with `--qo-mode qss` (now the
default) that writes an altitude-dependent Chapman QSS [O] profile
instead of `[O]=1e-12` uniform. Profile computed from

    [O]_ss = (2·jO2·[O2] + jO3_O·[O3]) / (k2·[O2]·[M] + k3·[O3])

using AFGL MLS T and [air] profiles, the canonical chapman_nox.yaml
rate constants, and a daytime mid-lat SZA~58° j-value climatology
extracted from this plan doc's earlier run logs. Produces
`qO = 5e-24 kg/kg` at surface → `6.7e-8 kg/kg` at the stratopause —
seven orders of magnitude dynamic range, matching the physical
dependence on altitude.

Re-init'd `chem_box_init.nc` with this profile and reran. qO3 evolution:

- t=0: 5.07e-6 (AFGL)
- t=5m: 6.62e-2 mean
- t=10m: 7.22e-2 mean

**Bit-for-bit identical to the uniform-seed runs.** Newton ignores
the QSS starting guess; it finds the wrong root anyway.

### Why none of this worked: the Jacobian analysis

For the Chapman [O]/[O3] null cycle the Jacobian of
`d[O]/dt` w.r.t. `[O]` is

    ∂(d[O]/dt)/∂[O] = -k2·[O2]·[M] - k3·[O3] ≈ -k2·[O2]·[M]

which **does not depend on [O]**. At surface, this eigenvalue is
≈ `-7×10⁴ s⁻¹` regardless of whether `[O]=0`, `[O]=1e-12`, or
`[O]=[O]_ss`. The nonlinear regime — the one in which the implicit
equation `y_new = y_old + dt·f(y_new)` admits multiple physically
distinct roots — is entered whenever

    dt · ||J|| >> 1   ⇔   dt >> 14 µs

At `dt = 3 s`, `dt·||J|| ≈ 2×10⁵`. Deep in the multi-root regime.
No starting guess, tolerance setting, or solver choice can move the
implicit equation's root structure; all that machinery affects which
root Newton or Rosenbrock lands on within the convergence neighborhood
of their starting guess, but BE and Rosenbrock at this dt have the
wrong-root attractor as a *stable* fixed point of their respective
discretizations. Once in its basin of attraction (which is large
here), Newton/Rosenbrock converge to it.

### 2026-04-19 correction: standalone column tests do not reproduce

The late-evening conclusion above was too strong. Two standalone
MUSICA column-model tests were run on macOS, outside the CheMPAS
coupler, to check whether daylight cold start + Chapman stiffness is
enough to reproduce the chem_box explosion.

**Test 1 — canonical MUSICA Chapman, daylight cold start.**
Temporary copy of `MUSICA-LLVM/fortran/examples/column_model.F90`
with only:

```fortran
START_UTC = 18.0_dk
```

Everything else stayed canonical: `configs/v1/chapman/config.json`,
TUV v5.4 column profiles, 15 min chemistry interval, `[O]=[O1D]=0`
initially. Result: no explosion. O3 stayed physical:

**Test 2 — CheMPAS `chapman_nox.yaml` in the standalone column
model.** Temporary column-model main loaded
`../v1/chapman_nox.yaml`, mapped TUV v5.4 photolysis channels into
`PHOTO.jO2`, `PHOTO.jO3_O`, `PHOTO.jO3_O1D`, and `PHOTO.jNO2`,
initialized NO/NO2 from the same broad profile shape as
`scripts/init_chapman.py`, and ran a chem_box-like daylight stress
case:

```fortran
DT_PHOTO = 3.0_dk
SIM_LENGTH = 600.0_dk
START_UTC = 18.0_dk
```

Result: no explosion. O3 stayed near the physical column profile:

The temporary files were:

- `/tmp/column_model_daylight.F90`
- `/tmp/column_model_daylight_run/configs/tuvx/column_model_fortran.csv`
- `/tmp/column_model_chapman_nox.F90`
- `/tmp/column_model_chapman_nox_run/configs/tuvx/column_model_fortran.csv`

These tests invalidate the claim that the mechanism, solver choice,
or daylight cold start alone explains the chem_box qO3 explosion.
`chapman_nox.yaml` itself is stable in standalone MICM/TUV-x at a 3 s
daylight cadence.

### Revised conclusion

The remaining suspect is CheMPAS-specific coupling or host-state
construction, not the raw MICM mechanism:

- MPAS → MICM concentration conversion or grid-cell ordering
- CheMPAS `state%rate_parameters` assignment
- CheMPAS TUV from-host profile path (`mpas_tuvx.F`) versus the
  standalone TUV v5.4 profile setup
- MPAS density, pressure, temperature, or vertical-coordinate inputs
- A mismatch between chem_box layer ordering and TUV/MICM column
  expectations

Do **not** proceed directly to QSS substitution as the next primary
fix. QSS substitution may still be useful eventually, but it would be
a scientific mechanism change and must go through human review.

Immediate next discriminator: run a tiny standalone MICM solve using
the exact cell-1 / level-1 step-1 inputs already logged from chem_box
(`T=299.09 K`, `P=98321 Pa`, `air_density=39.2 mol/m3`, the logged
species concentrations, and the logged four photolysis rates). If
that standalone solve explodes, the problem is in MICM behavior for
those exact inputs. If it stays stable, the bug is in CheMPAS state
layout, mapping, or per-column host-state construction.

### Current state shipped

- `SetRelativeTolerance` API in MUSICA-LLVM (generally useful for
  other stiff chemistry, not specifically for Chapman).
- `config_micm_relative_tolerance` and `config_chem_substeps`
  namelist plumbing in CheMPAS.
- `scripts/init_chapman.py --qo-mode {qss,uniform,zero}` with
  altitude-dependent QSS [O] seeding as the default.
- Solver default in `mpas_musica.F` flipped to
  `RosenbrockStandardOrder`; revert to `BackwardEulerStandardOrder`
  if mass balance becomes a concern in production runs.

None of these solve chapman_nox in chem_box. They stand as
infrastructure for the next round of coupling diagnostics.
